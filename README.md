Hospital Readmission Prediction
A machine learning project designed to predict whether a patient is likely to be readmitted to the hospital within a specific timeframe using electronic health records (EHR).

-> Project Overview

This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to analyze patient data and identify key risk factors associated with hospital readmissions. The model helps hospitals reduce unnecessary readmissions, improve patient care, and optimize resource allocation.

-> Key Features

Data Preprocessing & Cleaning: Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistent entries to ensure high-quality input.

Feature Engineering: Extracted meaningful variables (diagnosis patterns, treatment history, demographics, etc.) to strengthen prediction accuracy.

Model Development: Trained and evaluated classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

Performance Metrics: Assessed model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Discovered trends and correlations to understand critical medical risk factors.

-> Tech Stack

Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook

-> Outcomes

Improved prediction accuracy by identifying high-risk patients early.

Highlighted the medical variables most strongly correlated with readmission.

Built a reproducible pipeline for data processing, training, and evaluation.
